# 48. Other Algorithms

## Tasks Descriptions:

01.InfiniteCoins
You are given a set of infinite number of coins (1, 2 and 5) and end value â€“ N. Write an algorithm that gives the number of coins needed so that the sum of the coins equals N. Example: N = 33 => 6 coins x 5 + 1 coin x 2 + 1 coin x 1

02.TrianglePoints
You are given 3 points A, B and C, forming triangle, and a point P. Check if the point P is in the triangle or not. Note: This solution uses Barycentric coordinates. You can find more about them here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinates_%28mathematics%29
